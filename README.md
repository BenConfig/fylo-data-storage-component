## What I learned

To be honest, this wasn't the most difficult challenge I have attempted but it was a lot of fun. I think I managed to make my code very concise yet maintainable and I am pleased with the way I have structured the CSS in particular.

I tried out the `aspect-ratio` property for the first time. This allowed me to create square-shaped elements, and the size of the squares can be adjusted by only changing the `width` property (rather than having to change both `width` and `height` properties together).

## Continued development

I find with larger projects my code can sometimes become messy and bloated. Therefore I want to try some larger projects and see if I can keep the code minimal and well-structured, as I did with this smaller project.
